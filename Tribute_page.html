            According to WWE.com, "Ask any Superstar on the WWE roster who the most gifted sports-entertainer of all time is and nearly everyone will have the same answer — Shawn Michaels. A cocky, confident heartbreaker from San Antonio, Texas, HBK started off his
            career as one half of The Rockers and ended it in a classic match with The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVI. Along the way, he won every major WWE title, two Royal Rumbles, entry into the WWE Hall of Fame and a reputation as The Icon, The Showstopper,
            The Main Event. His days in the ring weren’t always glorious, though. After charming crowds as a Rocker in the ’90s, HBK infamously severed his partnership with Marty Jannetty by smashing his friend’s head through a window. And the notorious
            “Montreal Screwjob” of the 1997 Survivor Series involving his greatest rival, Bret “Hit Man” Hart, could have killed a lesser Superstar’s career. Instead, it only added to the allure of one of sports-entertainment’s most captivatingly flawed
            figures."
